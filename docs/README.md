## Account Related Commands

To start, you may need an account, [sign up](https://my.xervo.io/register) on 
the website. Once you have an account, you need to log in. Running the *login* 
command will prompt you for your Xervo credentials or if you have linked your 
GitHub account in the web portal (under account settings) you can use the 
*--github* flag to login using your GitHub credentials. This keeps a session 
open so you can run commands under your account and the session will not be 
closed unless you run the *logout* command or log in with a different account.

    $ xervo login

You can also reset your password.

    $ xervo resetPassword

And to logout:

    $ xervo logout


## API Tokens

It is possible to invoke commands that require authentication without logging
into a user account by using API tokens. This is especially useful when
automating actions such as deploys or sharing a Xervo project with multiple
developers without sharing a user name and password.

    $ xervo token create

API Tokens use the `XERVO_TOKEN` environment variable and can be used with any
command that requires authentication.

    $ XERVO_TOKEN=API-TOKEN xervo deploy

Manage the API tokens that you have created using the list and remove commands.

    $ xervo token list
    $ xervo token remove API-TOKEN


## Project Management

Once logged in, you are ready to create a project. This is done with the
*project create* command, and all that is required is a name.

    $ xervo project create

You can optionally pass in the name with *project create*.

    $ xervo project create "Lizard Locator"

You can also delete a project with *project delete*. Add the *-p* option to pass
in a project name.

    $ xervo project delete

To deploy an application to your new project, you can use either the *project
deploy* command or its shorter sidekick, *deploy*. This command will take all
the contents of your current directory, zip them up and deploy them. Once the
deploy has started, the progress will be displayed. When the deploy completes,
you have a running application on Xervo. You can redeploy a new version of the
project at any time using the same process.

    $ cd my/project/directory xervo deploy

The project's logs will be streamed in real-time during a deploy. You should see
some information about Xervo' activity, as well as the npm install process.

You can also pass in a directory as a command argument, if you do not want to
deploy the current directory.

    $ xervo deploy my/project/directory

If you know which project you want to deploy to, you can use the *-p* option and
provide the name of the project you would like to deploy to.

    $ xervo deploy -p "Lizard Locator" my/project/directory

You can specify the node and npm version that your Node.js/Meteor application will use.
For Node.js projects, you can specify this within the engines block in the `package.json`.

```json
{
  "engines": {
    "node": "4.4.7",
    "npm": "3.10.5"
  }
}
```

To specify the node and npm versions on Meteor projects you can deploy with the
--node-version and --npm-version flags

    $ xervo deploy -p "Lizard Locator" --node-version 4.4.3 --npm-version 3.10.5

Meteor projects can set the --debug flag on deploys.

    $ xervo deploy -p "Lizard Locator" --debug

To start, stop, or restart a project, use:

    $ xervo project start

    $ xervo project stop

    $ xervo project restart

The *-p* option is available with these commands as well.

To scale a project to use multiple servos in a single infrastructure/region, you
can use *project scale <number>*.

    $ xervo project scale 2

For multiple infrastructure providers and regions, you need more details.

    $ xervo project scale aws.us-east-1a=1 joyent.us-east-1=1

Note that existing scale options are overwritten with this command. For example,
if a project is scaled to Digital Ocean, this will remove the Digital Ocean
servos and you'll end up with 1 in AWS and 1 in Joyent.


## Servo Commands

You can now also view all of your servos with *servo list*.

    $ xervo servo list

And you can restart a single servo with *servo restart*.

    $ xervo servo restart

 The *-i* option allows you to specify a servo id.

    $ xervo servo restart -i SERVO-ID


## Environment Variables

The CLI also provides an easy way to manage a projectâ€™s environment variables.
You can start with listing your current variables with the *env list* command.

    $ xervo env list

To add a new variable, use the *env set* command. It takes two parameters, name
and value. This command can also be used to change the value of an existing
variable.

    $ xervo env set DB_AUTH 12345

If you have no need for a variable anymore, you can provide the *env delete*
command with a name and it will be removed from the project.

    $ xervo env delete DB_AUTH

At any time, if you want to view the value of a single variable, use the *env
get* command. It takes a name parameter and will display the value of the
variable of the name you specify.


## MongoDB Database Management

Once logged in, you can create a MongoDB database. This is done with the *mongo
create* command, and all that is required is a name.

    $ xervo mongo create

You can optionally pass in the name with *mongo create*.

    $ xervo mongo create "Lizard Locator DB"

Once a database has been created a user should be added to it. Use the *mongo
user create* command to create a database user.

    $ xervo mongo user create


## Add-Ons Management

After logging in, you can set up add-ons for your project. To add an add-on to a
project, use *addons add*:

    $ xervo addons add keen:developer

Remove add-ons using *addons remove*:

    $ xervo addons list
    $ xervo addons remove keen


## Logs

In times when you need to check up on your projects, you can view the project's
logs. This is done with the *project logs* command, which supports the *-p*
option.

    $ xervo project logs -p "Lizard Locator"

While these logs are not streamed directly to the CLI, the logs themselves are
updated in real-time, so anytime you retrieve them they are current. To stream
your project's logs, you can use *logs tail*.

    $ xervo project logs tail


## Status

The *status* command allows you to view the status of Xervo as set on
status.xervo.io.

    $ xervo status
